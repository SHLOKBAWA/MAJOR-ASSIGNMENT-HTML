				<p style="color:blue; font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:20px;"><b>Our heritage as an economic powerhouse runs deep. The MeTL Group began as a family business started by my father AKASH BAWA, a small trading company which was then turned into one of the largest industrial conglomerates in East Africa, with interests ranging trading, agriculture, manufacturing, energy & petroleum, financial services, mobile telephonyinfrastructure and real estate, transport, logistics & distribution. After studying business at Georgetown University, I joined my father’s business in 1999, since then MeTL Group has grown significantly, diversifying to sectors never before thought possible. This company profile will outline the depth of MeTL Group’s presence in Tanzania, the brand that we have and how far we have come over the years.

MeTL Group is Tanzania’s largest homegrown company with Revenues of more than $1.5 billion, employing more than 24,000 people and with a presence in 12 countries in Africa, including Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Dubai, DR Congo and of course Tanzania. We have the best available talent and are consistently investing in our people and our infrastructure. The $1.5 billion revenue from our group of companies constitutes a little over 3.5% of the GDP of Tanzania and employs 5% of the formal employment sector. By 2018 we expect to hit revenues of $5 billion.

MeTL Group supports several causes through the Mo Dewji foundation. Over the last five years, we have spent more than $3 million developing schools, providing education, improving health care, and providing water supply inventions to create income generation.</b></p>

				<p style="color:blue; font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:20px;"><b>Rare is the gifted teenager who is not bored in high school. Yet few have signaled their boredom as extravagantly as Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical company founder who was sent to jail on Wednesday to await sentencing for a fraud conviction.

Mr. Shkreli was a chronic class-skipper who, friends have said, preferred to spend his time on chess and playing guitar in a band. His highly selective Manhattan school asked him to stop attending.

Entrepreneurs, it turns out, do not just move fast and break things, as Facebook’s longtime credo put it. They are also more likely than others to cross the line.

According to research by the economists Ross Levine and Yona Rubinstein, people who become entrepreneurs are not only apt to have had high self-esteem while growing up (and to have been white, male and financially secure). They are also more likely than others to have been intelligent people who engaged in illicit activities in their teenage years and early 20s.</b></p>
